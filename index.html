            <p>Bake Off 2022 will be released on Tuesday, September 13th at 8pm BST, on Netflix and Channel 4, and confirmed to be 
                judged by Paul and Prue and hosted by Matt and Noel. The first teaser trailer  aired on Channel 4 on August 23rd. This trailer did not have any images of the 
                constestants, just a faraway shot of the tent in the distance and a squirrel running across the countryside with 
                the words, "Coming Soon". Filming for the season ran from April to August of 2022. This season features 12 bakers,
                ranging from ages 18-60, with professions of all different varieties.</p>
